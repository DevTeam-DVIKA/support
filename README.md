Here’s a high-level blueprint for a two-sided support system—one “Customer” side and one “Admin” side—showing the architecture, data-flow and key components you’ll need to build in React (frontend) + Node/Mongo (backend), but you can swap in whatever stacks you prefer.

---

## 1. System Architecture

```mermaid

  subgraph Frontend
    U[User Support Page]
    A[Admin Dashboard]
  end

  subgraph Backend
    API[REST / GraphQL API]
    WS[WebSocket Service]
    DB[(MongoDB Tickets)]
    Mail[SMTP / Mail Service]
    Queue[Message Queue]
  end

  U -->|POST /tickets| API
  API --> DB
  API -->|emit ticket.new| WS
  API --> Mail
  A -->|GET /tickets| API
  A -->|POST /tickets/:id/reply| API
  API --> Queue
  Queue --> Mail
  WS <-->|live updates| A
  WS <-->|live status| U
```

* **Frontend**

  * **User Support Page**: “Submit Request” form (you already have), plus a “Track Ticket” view where user enters Ticket ID to see status & replies.
  * **Admin Dashboard**: central ticket list, filters (status, priority, category), detail panel (conversation thread + reply composer), agent-assignment controls.

* **Backend**

  * **API Layer** (Node/Express or GraphQL) to handle create/read/update of tickets, replies, status changes.
  * **WebSocket Service** (Socket.io or server-sent events) for real-time push of new tickets and replies.
  * **Database**: a `tickets` collection, each doc:

    ```js
    {
      _id,
      customer: { name, email, phone },
      category, priority, subject, createdAt, status, 
      thread: [ { from: "user"|"admin", message, timestamp } ],
      assignedTo?: agentId
    }
    ```
  * **Mail/Notifications**: SMTP or third-party (SendGrid) to notify user when admin replies.
  * **Message Queue** (optional) to buffer email jobs.

---

## 2. Customer-Facing Flow

1. **Submit Ticket**

   * Fill out form → `POST /tickets` → creates ticket, returns `ticketId`.
   * Show “Success” modal (you have this) with `ticketId`.

2. **Track & Reply**

   * “Track Ticket” page where user enters ID → `GET /tickets/:id` → displays ticket metadata + thread.
   * Optionally allow user to append additional messages: `POST /tickets/:id/reply`.

3. **Real-Time Updates**

   * Use WebSocket or polling so if admin responds, user sees reply immediately.

---

## 3. Admin-Facing Flow

1. **Dashboard List**

   * On load: `GET /tickets?status=open` → paginated table: columns \[ID, customer, subject, priority, status, createdAt].
   * Filters: status, priority, category, date-range.

2. **Detail & Reply Panel**

   * Click a row → slide-out panel or modal → fetch `GET /tickets/:id` → show:

     * Customer info
     * Thread (user & previous replies)
     * Controls: change status (open, pending, closed), reassign agent, priority/category edit.
     * Reply textarea → `POST /tickets/:id/reply`.

3. **Live Notifications**

   * Socket.io listener for `ticket.new` so agents see new incoming tickets in real time.
   * Desktop/browser notification badge.

4. **Agent Assignment & SLA**

   * Auto-assign to agent pools, or manual assign.
   * Show SLA countdown (e.g. “respond within 24 hrs”) with visual cue.

---

## 4. Component & Folder Structure (React)

```
src/
├─ api/                   ← axios or graphql clients
├─ components/
│  ├─ Customer/
│  │  ├─ SubmitForm.js
│  │  ├─ TicketTracker.js
│  ├─ Admin/
│  │  ├─ TicketTable.js
│  │  ├─ TicketDetailPanel.js
│  │  ├─ FiltersBar.js
│  ├─ UI/                 ← Buttons, Modals, Inputs, Icons
├─ contexts/              ← Auth, WebSocketContext
├─ hooks/                 ← useTickets, useWebSocket
├─ pages/
│  ├─ /support            ← customer
│  │  ├─ index.js
│  ├─ /admin              ← admin
│  │  ├─ index.js
└─ utils/                 ← date formatting, notification helpers
```

* **State Management**: React Context or Redux for global (tickets list, auth, socket).
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (as you’re using), keep design tokens in a single file for consistency.

## 5. API Endpoints (REST Example)

| Method | Path                 | Body / Query                        | Function                                  |
| ------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /tickets             | `{ customer, subject, message… }`   | Create ticket                             |
| GET    | /tickets             | `?status=open&priority=high&page=…` | List & filter tickets                     |
| GET    | /tickets/\:id        | —                                   | Get single ticket with full thread        |
| POST   | /tickets/\:id/reply  | `{ from: "admin", message }`        | Append reply & trigger notification/email |
| PATCH  | /tickets/\:id/status | `{ status: "closed" }`              | Change ticket status                      |
| PATCH  | /tickets/\:id/assign | `{ agentId: "…" }`                  | Assign to agent                           |

---

## 6. Data-Flow & Real-Time

1. **User submits** → API writes to DB → emits `ticket.new` over WebSocket + sends confirmation email.
2. **Admin dashboard** hears `ticket.new` → highlights new row.
3. **Admin replies** → API updates DB thread → enqueues email to user + emits `ticket.reply` to both admin & user socket rooms.
4. **User socket** receives `ticket.reply` → appends to thread view live.

---

## 7. Scaling & Extras

* **Pagination & Caching**: use cursor-based pagination for large ticket volume.
* **Search & Full-Text**: index subject/message in Mongo or add ElasticSearch for advanced queries.
* **RBAC**: protect admin routes with JWT + roles.
* **Attachments**: support file uploads by streaming to S3 and storing link in thread.
* **Analytics**: track metrics (avg response time, tickets per category) and expose in admin “Stats” panel.

---

With this foundation you can evolve a simple React form into a full-featured support center. Feel free to ask for deeper dives on any section (e.g. sample Express code, WebSocket setup, detailed React hook patterns, or DB migration scripts)!

# Dvika Support Center Architecture & Layout

> *External brand: “Dvika Care”*
> Support email: **[dvika.care@gmail.com](mailto:dvika.care@gmail.com)**

---

## Two-Sided Support System

**External User (Dvika Care)**

* Submit support requests via web form, email, chat widget, or API
* Track ticket status and replies
* Browse FAQs and Knowledge Base

**Internal Admin & Agents**

* View and triage incoming tickets
* Reply, escalate, and manage SLAs
* Access analytics and reporting dashboards

---

## Ticket Lifecycle & Statuses

1. **New** – just created (via web, email, widget, or API)
2. **Open / Triaging** – agent picks up for initial assessment
3. **In Progress** – actively being worked
4. **On Hold / Waiting on Customer** – blocked until user supplies info
5. **Escalated** – handed off to L2 or engineering
6. **Resolved** – solution provided; awaiting confirmation
7. **Closed** – confirmed resolved or auto-closed after X days

> *Each status change triggers internal notifications and ticks against SLA timers.*

---

## Channels of Intake

* **Dvika Care Bot** (in-app & chat widget)
* **Email** ([support@dvika.care](mailto:support@dvika.care)@gmail.com)
* **Slack Slash-Command** (`/dvika-care new`)
* **API / Webhook** (partner integrations)

> *All incoming items auto-create tickets with captured fields (user, issue type, priority, attachments).*

---

## Triage & Routing Rules

* **Keyword-Based Tagging** (e.g. “billing” → Billing queue)
* **Priority Mapping** (P1 bugs escalate immediately)
* **Round-Robin or Load-Based Assignment** among available agents
* **Auto-Escalation** if not picked up within SLA window

---

## Internal Dashboard & Views

| View                  | Visible To           | Key Columns                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| My Open Tickets       | Support Agents       | Ticket #, Subject, Priority, Age   |
| All Tickets           | Managers & Admin     | + Queue, Assigned To, SLA Status   |
| Escalation Queue      | Managers & Engineers | + Origin Agent, Escalation Reason  |
| SLA Breaches          | Managers             | Ticket #, Breach Type, Breach Time |
| Knowledge Suggestions | All                  | Auto-suggested KB article links    |

---

## Knowledge Base Integration

* Contextual article suggestions as tickets are typed
* One-click “Insert KB link” in agent replies
* Feedback loop: agents flag outdated articles or suggest new ones

---

## Automations & Macros

* Canned responses for FAQs (onboarding, pricing, API keys)
* Macros to update status + add internal note + notify user
* SLA reminders: Slack pings 30 min before breach
* Auto-close inactive tickets (> 7 days) with customer nudge

---

## Notifications & Escalations

* Slack alerts in `#dvika-care-alerts`
* Email digests for managers (daily summary of new, breached, escalated)
* Push notifications in internal app

---

## Reporting & Analytics

* First response time (avg. by agent / queue)
* Resolution time (avg. and distribution)
* Ticket volume trends (daily / weekly)
* CSAT surveys embedded in resolved tickets
* Heatmaps of peak request hours

> *Embed dashboards (e.g. Metabase, Data Studio) into the Admin view.*
